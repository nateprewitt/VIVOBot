VIVOBot
--------------

VIVOBot is a simple python class used to perform basic actions in VIVO via a scripting interface.

This will allow you to do things like run inference, upload an ontology file, or perform queries with a cronjob.

You can also use this to perform quick data retrievals out of VIVO for data mashups or complex processing that you
would prefer to do in a programming environment.
